            and
            do.</p>
        <p>You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our

            Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready
            to

            get to
            explore and experiment with our team of experts.</p>
        <p>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a
            journey
            of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how
            you can
