<h1>Explorer together</h1>
<p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to all.</p>

<h2>For kids</h2>
<p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and
    do.</p>
<p>You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident
    Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to
    learn and explore.</p>
<p>We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to
    explore and experiment with our team of experts.</p>
<p>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey
    of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can
    join, send us a message.</p>

<h2>For teachers</h2>
<p>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and exploring. Our team are
    on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide great
    video presentations that will excite and inspire them.</p>
<p>Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students
    through for a visit.</p>

<h2>Researchers</h2>
<p>Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to
    use our resources and contribute towards them. We have online records, laboratory space, and a working relationship
    with a number of universities around the country.</p>
