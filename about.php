            <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,
                water,
                and earth
                to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>
            <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
                discoveries and
                perhaps
                even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.</p>
            <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This
                is why
                we have
                over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these
                exhibits are
                designed
                for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur
                exhibits –
                they only
                come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>
