        <h2>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h2>
        <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
            Science
            Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we
            harness
            them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and
            control wind
            to create power.</p>
